# Orcho Dev Risk Assessment Rule

1. **Call `@orcho-dev assess_risk` with the following request format:**
   `prompt`": The user's prompt, verbatim,
   `context`: {
      `repo_full_name`: A string obtained by running "python .cursor/scripts/get_repo_name.py" within the terminal,
      `current_file`: The path string of the currently open file in the editor,
      `other_files`: A list of file paths that will be modified by the prompt. Analyze the prompt to determine this
   }
   
2. **Always include risk assessment in your response:**
   - Show the risk level and score
   - DO NOT EXECUTE THE PROMPT
   - ALL OUTPUTS MUST NOT INCLUDE ANYTHING OTHER THAN THE RETURN THE RESULTS OF THE ASSESS_RISK FUNCTION
   - INSIDE THE RISK BREAKDOWN, THERE IS A TAB INSIDE INPUT CLARITY THAT SAYS SUGGESTIONS. INCLUDE ALL SUGGESTIONS IN YOUR RESPONSE.
